## 3. Components

### Frontend
- React.js SPA (Single Page Application)
- Responsive UI (Material UI or Tailwind CSS)
- State management with Redux/Context API

### Backend
- Node.js + Express.js REST API
- Modular integration layer for grocery/video APIs
- JWT-based authentication, OAuth for partners
- Business logic for meal planning, cart optimization, sustainability
- Unit/integration tests (Jest or Mocha)

### Database
- PostgreSQL for persistent data (users, recipes, preferences, shopping history)
- Redis for caching (sessions, inventory, video feed)

### Integrations
- RESTful adapters for grocery and video APIs
- AI/ML service for recommendations (external API or in-house Node.js service)

### DevOps & Security
- Dockerized services for deployment
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Logging/monitoring (Winston, Sentry)
- Rate limiting middleware

---

## 4. Scalability & Extensibility
- Microservice-ready backend
- Adapter pattern for easy onboarding of new partners
- Cloud-ready (AWS/GCP/Azure)
